# QuickBasic45
A place where I can keep old QuickBASIC programs


## QBGUI
WINDOW.BAS - A GUI I wrote with optimizations to run as quick as possible in pure QB
* UI elemnts such as windows, buttons, scrollbars, progressbar, spinner
* Text rendering with custom 8x8 fonts and text container alignment
* ICO and BMP loading
* Custom mouse cursor

Start QB using `QB.EXE /L QB.QLB`. Assumes current working directory to be the same as location of the .BAS files.
