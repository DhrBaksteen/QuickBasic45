# QuickBasic45
A place where I keep old and new QuickBASIC programs.

All source has been saved as text files. Some of these have been modified to get rid of absolute paths in the code.
Whenever additional files are needed for the program the working directory is assumed to be the same as the derictory of
the .BAS file.

## 1STLOVE
A smooth scrolling demo like effect in screen 12.

## CARDS
A never finished blackjack game.

## CRYPT
A never finished dungeon crawl game...
* PC speaker music and separate player in PLAYMUS.BAS
* Some interesting graphics with separate viewer in RECALL.BAS

## QBGUI
WINDOW.BAS - A GUI I wrote with optimizations to run as quick as possible in pure QB
* UI elemnts such as windows, buttons, scrollbars, progressbar, spinner
* Text rendering with custom 8x8 fonts and text container alignment
* ICO and BMP loading
* Custom mouse cursor

Start QB using `QB.EXE /L QB.QLB`. Assumes current working directory to be the same as location of the .BAS files.

## Other loose bits and pieces
* **CHARSET.BAS** - Shows how SCREEN 0 character bitmaps can be changed.
* **CLOCK.BAS** - A clock for my Tulip PC Compact 2. An XT with Hercules video card.
* **EXPORMD2.BAS** - Remake / sequel to one of the first QBasic games I wrote in 1997: 'Explosieven Opruimingsdienst 2'.
* **FRACTAL.BAS** - Draws tree like fractals for Hercules card.
* **GW_SUBS.BAS** - GW Basic submarine hunt game in CGA.
* **MYSTIFY.BAS** - Windows 3.1 mystify like screensave for Hercules card.
* **MATURE.BAS** - More tree like fractals for Hercules card.
* **PLANET.BAS** - Drawing of a wireframe planet.
* **SCOOPY.BAS** - Simple game where you try to steel an excavator and kill your pass by dropping rubble on him.
* **STARS.BAS** - Colorful EGA stars screensaver.
* **SUPRNOVA.BAS** - Text mode supernova screensaver.
